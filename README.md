# Hash-Password-Generator
You can use hashes (like the Bitcoin Hashes) to randomly create passwords.

You can use it basically to create any random passowrds, with or without the hashes all that it requires is a bit of string that will be randomized with the algorithm and give you a random password everytime.

If you want to use different random hashes you can connect with an API and always get the latest hash.
